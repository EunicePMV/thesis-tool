bali acquisition -> annotation -> 1st phase testing with (m)svm
after ma test pwede na gumawa ng pipeline for pre-process (though di ko sure kung ano ung pinakabest process, kumbago ano dapat mauna)
normalize -> [norm-techniques -> resize] -> enhance -> segment  -> FE -> 2nd testing phase (vanilla msvm without FS)

then gagawan na ng mga wrapper MSVM

annotation:
1. get annotated datasets - roboflow
2. annotate own datasets 
    2.1 manual - roboflow, makesense AI
    2.2 automatic - 

Roboflow 
1. 

MakeSense AI 
1. upload image 
2. rectangle can only be used as annotation to export VOC XML annotation file

FILE: ovo.py and ovr.py
1. train MSVM with images with the following disease -> annotation
    1.1 Train MSVM with file method annotated images / folder method images
    1.2 Train MSVM with the annotated images 

    - what is the steps involve in supervised machine learning 
        according to GPT (https://chat.openai.com/c/a9b1e31b-d76f-45b7-850e-98850b6f915f):
        1. data collection and preprocessing (resize, convert color, flatten/reshape)
        2. data splitting
        3. feature scaling / normalization -> crucial for svm
        4. SVM model selection
        5. model training
        6. model evaluation

FLOW TO DO:
1. segmentation and normalization of dataset
2. study about the feature extraction to used 
3. test with MSVM


# CURRENT TRAIL OF FLOW:
# 1. iterate to the dataset-color_enhanced folder
#     segment each image and store segmented leaf images per class
# 2. extract features for the segmented leaf image -> where to store?

CURRENT PREPROCESSING:
1. resize & white balance
2. guassian blur / bilateral filter
3. segment
4. morphological operation

TRIAL: SUCCESS
1. resize & white balance
2. bilateral filter
3. edge detection


NOW:
1. Sir Mike (Consultation)
    - fix dataset 70%/80% success semgented dataset
    - feature extraction for each image per class 
    - train MSVM with evaluation result
2. improved no. 1 process / steps
